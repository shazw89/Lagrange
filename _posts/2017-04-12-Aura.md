For my final project, my groupmates and I wanted to enable users to hear sound or see colour. Thus, Aura was born. Our users select a random sound, choose a colour they feel matches the sound and see the colours other users have chosen as a beautiful background gradient. We’d like to continue to develop it by allowing our users to build their own animations from the hues they’ve chosen to visualise sound in a novel way.
